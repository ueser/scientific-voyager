# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Scientific Voyager

## Overview
The **Scientific Voyager** is an AI-driven exploratory research platform inspired by the concept of autonomous agents in open-world learning environments (e.g., Minecraft Voyager). Its primary aim is to autonomously explore, extract, index, synthesize, and generate novel insights from scientific literature, emphasizing multi-scale biological understanding and hierarchical emergent behaviors.

## Vision and Goals

### Vision
Enable researchers to leverage AI-driven autonomous exploration for accelerated and deeper biological discoveries through structured, interconnected scientific knowledge, exploiting emergent behaviors via generalized triangulation.

### Goals
- Autonomously extract and structure information from scientific literature.
- Create hierarchical and interconnected scientific knowledge across multiple biological scales (genetic, molecular, cellular, system, organism).
- Generate actionable, non-trivial scientific insights automatically using generalized triangulation.
- Provide flexible goal-oriented task definitions for ongoing exploration.
- Facilitate intuitive indexing and retrieval of structured knowledge.

## Features and Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Multi-scale Hierarchical Model**
   - Categorize statements extracted from literature into multiple biological levels:
     - Genetic
     - Molecular
     - Cellular
     - Systems
     - Organism

2. **Statement Categorization and Indexing**
   - Assign each statement extracted from abstracts a type (causal, descriptive, intervention, definitional).
   - Extract and index biomedical terms and concepts for efficient retrieval.

3. **Graph Chain (Knowledge Graph)**
   - Visualize and manage interconnected relationships between categorized statements.

4. **Insights Chain**
   - Continuously generate and record non-trivial insights derived from generalized triangulation of multiple abstracts.
   - Insights explicitly support overarching scientific goals and trace sources clearly.

5. **Next Task Chain**
   - Dynamically generate subsequent tasks based on current knowledge state and defined criteria.
   - Clearly formatted outputs including reasoning, explicit tasks, and key focus keywords.

### Technical Requirements
- **Execution Engine:**
  - Modular design using OpenAI GPT-4o for NLP-related tasks.
  - Accommodate multiple data resources (PubMed, proprietary datasets).

- **Data Management:**
  - Transition from local storage to a robust database system (Neo4j, ChromaDB).
  - Unique identifier (UID) assignment for traceability of statements and insights.

- **Search and Retrieval:**
  - Keyword and concept-based retrieval of indexed statements and insights.

- **Integration and Scalability:**
  - Flexible architecture to integrate additional execution engines.
  - Scalable data infrastructure supporting expansion of scientific domains beyond biology.

### User Experience (UX)
- Intuitive visualization dashboards for exploring hierarchical relationships and insights.
- User-defined overarching goals guiding AI exploration.
- Interactive interface for defining and refining exploratory criteria and tasks.

## Constraints
- NLP processing must utilize OpenAI GPT-4o.
- Insights must result from generalized triangulation across multiple scientific sources.
- Ensure traceability and clear linkage between hierarchical emergent behaviors and underlying concepts.

## Insights and Hierarchical Emergent Behaviors
- Systematically explore and highlight emergent behaviors arising from complex hierarchical biological interactions.
  - Example: Molecular mechanisms driving megakaryocyte (Mgk) division.
  - Mgk over-proliferation leading to increased platelets.
  - Increased platelets potentially causing thrombocytosis.
- Recognize multiple underlying mechanisms leading to the same emergent biological behavior, systematically mapping these hierarchical relationships.

## Success Criteria
- Effective autonomous generation of non-trivial insights demonstrably useful in scientific contexts.
- Significant reduction in manual effort for literature review and insight synthesis.
- Clear traceability of generated insights to source abstracts or synthesized sources.

## Milestones and Phases

### Phase 1: Prototype
- Build basic statement extraction, categorization, and indexing capability.
- Develop initial graph and insights chains.
- Proof of concept demonstration using PubMed data.

### Phase 2: MVP
- Implement robust storage and retrieval database.
- Enhanced insights extraction (non-trivial, multi-source triangulation).
- Dynamic next-task generation.

### Phase 3: Production Release
- Scalable architecture supporting multiple execution engines and data sources.
- Advanced visualization and user interaction dashboards.
- Deployment in scientific research contexts and user feedback incorporation.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Complexity of multi-level categorization:**
  - Start with a clear scope (limited number of biological domains).
- **Data quality and synthesis accuracy:**
  - Continuous validation and iterative refinement of extraction algorithms.
- **Scalability:**
  - Design scalable architecture from inception, integrating modern graph databases.

## Future Considerations
- Expansion into other scientific disciplines beyond biology (e.g., pharmacology, ecology).
- Integration of real-time updates from continuous literature monitoring.
- Collaborative features enabling community-driven knowledge curation and refinement.
