# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Interactive Knowledge Graph Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a dynamic, interactive visualization for knowledge graphs that allows users to explore relationships between entities
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Set up a visualization library (e.g., D3.js, Cytoscape.js) for network graph rendering
2. Implement node and edge rendering with appropriate styling
3. Add interactive capabilities: zooming, panning, node selection, and expansion
4. Create hover tooltips showing entity details and relationship information
5. Implement search and focus functionality to locate specific nodes
6. Add ability to expand/collapse node clusters
7. Optimize rendering for large graphs with level-of-detail techniques

Testing approach:
- Unit test graph rendering functions
- Test interaction handlers with mock data
- Verify performance with large datasets
- Test across different browsers for compatibility

## 2. Build Hierarchical Biological Scale Viewer [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop a visualization component that allows users to navigate through hierarchical biological scales, from molecular to ecosystem levels
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design the hierarchical data structure to represent biological scales
2. Implement a tree or collapsible list visualization for navigating scales
3. Create smooth transitions between different scale levels
4. Add breadcrumb navigation to show current position in hierarchy
5. Implement filtering to focus on specific branches of the hierarchy
6. Connect to the knowledge graph visualization to show related entities at each scale
7. Add contextual information panels for each scale level

Testing approach:
- Verify correct rendering of hierarchical structures
- Test navigation between different scales
- Validate that transitions are smooth and intuitive
- Ensure proper integration with the knowledge graph visualization

## 3. Create Insights Explorer with Filtering and Sorting [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Develop an interface for browsing, filtering, and sorting insights derived from the knowledge base
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a card-based or list-based UI for displaying insights
2. Implement filtering controls (dropdowns, checkboxes, search) for categories, tags, dates, etc.
3. Create sorting options (relevance, date, importance, etc.)
4. Add pagination or infinite scrolling for large result sets
5. Implement quick-view and detailed-view modes for insights
6. Create visual indicators for insight relationships and connections
7. Add ability to bookmark or save important insights
8. Implement export functionality for selected insights

Testing approach:
- Test filtering with various combinations of criteria
- Verify sorting works correctly across different data types
- Validate pagination/infinite scrolling with large datasets
- Test export functionality with different output formats

## 4. Develop Task Management Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Build a UI for creating, tracking, and managing research tasks and goals, with integration to the visualization components
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design task creation form with fields for title, description, priority, deadline, etc.
2. Implement task list view with sorting and filtering capabilities
3. Create task detail view showing related insights and knowledge graph entities
4. Add progress tracking and status update functionality
5. Implement drag-and-drop for task organization and prioritization
6. Create notification system for task deadlines and updates
7. Build user goal definition and refinement tools
8. Implement exploration history tracking connected to tasks

Testing approach:
- Test task CRUD operations
- Verify filtering and sorting in task lists
- Test task-insight and task-entity relationships
- Validate notifications and reminders
- Test goal tracking and refinement functionality

## 5. Implement Responsive Dashboard Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Create a customizable, responsive dashboard that integrates all visualization components and adapts to different device sizes
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a grid-based layout system for dashboard components
2. Implement drag-and-drop functionality for dashboard customization
3. Create responsive breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile views
4. Develop widget system for different visualization types (graphs, lists, stats)
5. Implement dashboard state persistence and user preferences
6. Add dashboard sharing and export functionality
7. Create dashboard templates for common use cases
8. Implement a unified styling system for consistent UI across components

Testing approach:
- Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
- Verify dashboard customization and persistence
- Test integration of all visualization components
- Validate performance with multiple widgets active
- Test export and sharing functionality
- Conduct usability testing with representative users
