# Task ID: 14
# Title: Update Documentation and Example Scripts for Multi-label and Cross-scale Classification
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update example scripts and documentation to demonstrate how to use the system for multi-label classification and cross-scale categorization of biological statements.
# Details:
This task involves creating comprehensive documentation and example scripts that showcase the multi-scale hierarchical model's capabilities. Specifically:

1. Create Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step examples showing:
   - How to extract and classify statements across multiple biological scales
   - How to handle statements that belong to multiple categories simultaneously
   - Best practices for interpreting cross-scale relationships
   - Common edge cases and their solutions

2. Update the documentation to include:
   - Clear explanations of the multi-label classification methodology
   - Visual diagrams showing the hierarchical relationships between scales
   - API reference for all relevant functions with parameter descriptions
   - Performance metrics and expected accuracy across different biological domains

3. Provide concrete examples using real biological statements that demonstrate:
   - Genetic to molecular scale transitions
   - Molecular to cellular scale relationships
   - Cellular to systems level classifications
   - Organism-level statement categorization
   - Statements that span multiple scales simultaneously

4. Include optimization guidelines for users working with different types of biological literature or datasets.

# Test Strategy:
Validation should include:

1. User testing with 3-5 researchers not familiar with the system to verify they can successfully follow the examples and documentation to classify sample statements.

2. Technical verification:
   - Run all example scripts to ensure they execute without errors
   - Verify that all documented API calls work as described
   - Test all code snippets in the documentation for correctness
   - Ensure compatibility with the current version of the system

3. Content validation:
   - Confirm all biological scale transitions are accurately represented
   - Verify that multi-label classification examples correctly show how statements can belong to multiple categories
   - Check that edge cases mentioned in the documentation have working solutions

4. Documentation completeness check:
   - Create a checklist of all system features related to multi-label and cross-scale classification
   - Ensure each feature has corresponding documentation and examples
   - Verify that performance metrics and limitations are honestly represented

The task is complete when new users can successfully implement multi-label and cross-scale classification using only the documentation and example scripts.
