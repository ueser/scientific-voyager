# Task ID: 12
# Title: Enhance Classification System for Multi-scale Statement Output and Relationship Mapping
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the existing classification and extraction logic to support multiple scale/type assignments per statement and identify cross-scale relationships between extracted statements.
# Details:
This task involves enhancing the current classification system to move beyond single-scale categorization to a more nuanced approach where statements can belong to multiple biological scales simultaneously. Key implementation points include:

1. Modify the classifier architecture to output probability distributions across all scales (genetic, molecular, cellular, systems, organism) rather than just the top category
2. Implement a threshold-based approach to assign multiple scales to statements when confidence scores exceed defined thresholds
3. Develop relationship detection algorithms to identify connections between statements across different scales (e.g., how a molecular process relates to a cellular function)
4. Update the database schema to support many-to-many relationships between statements and scales/types
5. Create a relationship table to store and query cross-scale connections
6. Modify the extraction pipeline to preserve context that helps establish these relationships
7. Implement natural language processing techniques to detect causal, correlative, or hierarchical relationships between statements
8. Update the API response format to include multi-scale classifications and relationship data

The implementation should maintain backward compatibility with systems expecting single-scale classifications while extending functionality for multi-scale awareness.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the multi-scale classification accuracy and relationship detection capabilities:

1. Classification Testing:
   - Create a test dataset of 100+ statements with gold-standard multi-scale annotations
   - Measure precision, recall, and F1 scores for multi-scale classification
   - Verify that statements previously classified correctly maintain accurate primary classifications
   - Test edge cases where statements clearly span multiple scales
   - Verify the system can handle statements with 1, 2, 3, or more applicable scales

2. Relationship Detection Testing:
   - Develop test cases with known relationships between statements across scales
   - Measure accuracy of relationship detection against expert-annotated ground truth
   - Test with both explicit relationships ("X causes Y") and implicit relationships
   - Verify relationship directionality is correctly captured

3. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark processing time to ensure multi-scale classification doesn't significantly impact performance
   - Test with large batches (1000+ statements) to verify scalability

4. Integration Testing:
   - Verify downstream systems can properly consume the enhanced output format
   - Test visualization components with multi-scale data
   - Ensure search and filtering functionality works with multi-scale classifications
