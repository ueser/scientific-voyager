# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Knowledge Graph Construction
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the Graph Chain component that creates and manages interconnected relationships between categorized statements.
# Details:
Design graph data structure with nodes (statements) and edges (relationships). Implement relationship extraction using GPT-4o to identify connections between statements. Create graph traversal algorithms for exploring connected concepts. Build graph manipulation operations (merge, split, connect). Implement graph persistence layer. Develop mechanisms to handle conflicting or contradictory relationships. Create graph integrity validation tools.

# Test Strategy:
Test graph construction with known relationship sets. Validate relationship extraction accuracy. Measure graph traversal performance. Test cycle detection and resolution. Verify persistence and retrieval of complex graph structures. Test graph operations under concurrent modifications.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Graph Data Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the fundamental graph data structure with nodes representing statements and edges representing relationships between statements.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Define Node class with properties for statement ID, content, category, and metadata
2. Define Edge class with properties for relationship type, source node, target node, and confidence score
3. Create Graph class that maintains collections of nodes and edges
4. Implement basic graph operations: add/remove nodes, add/remove edges, find nodes/edges
5. Add methods for basic graph statistics (node count, edge count, density)
6. Create serialization/deserialization methods for the graph structure

Testing approach:
- Unit test each class and method with sample data
- Test graph operations with small sample graphs
- Verify correct handling of edge cases (empty graph, disconnected nodes)

## 2. Implement Relationship Extraction using GPT-4o [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop a component that uses GPT-4o to identify and extract relationships between statements in the knowledge graph.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design prompt templates for GPT-4o to analyze relationships between statements
2. Create a RelationshipExtractor class that interfaces with the GPT-4o API
3. Implement batch processing to efficiently analyze multiple statement pairs
4. Develop parsing logic to convert GPT-4o responses into structured relationship data
5. Add confidence scoring for extracted relationships
6. Implement caching mechanism to avoid redundant API calls

Testing approach:
- Test with diverse statement pairs to ensure relationship detection accuracy
- Validate response parsing with sample GPT-4o outputs
- Measure extraction performance and optimize batch sizes
- Compare relationship extraction results with human annotations on test dataset

## 3. Develop Graph Traversal and Manipulation Algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create algorithms for exploring and manipulating the knowledge graph, including traversal, searching, and operations like merging and splitting.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement depth-first and breadth-first traversal algorithms
2. Create path-finding algorithms between nodes (shortest path, all paths)
3. Develop node clustering algorithms to identify related statement groups
4. Implement graph operations: merge subgraphs, split graphs, connect subgraphs
5. Create search functionality to find nodes/paths based on content or relationship criteria
6. Add graph analysis tools (centrality measures, connected components)

Testing approach:
- Test traversal algorithms on graphs with known structures
- Verify path-finding with pre-computed expected paths
- Test manipulation operations with before/after state validation
- Benchmark algorithm performance with graphs of various sizes

## 4. Implement Conflict Resolution Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Develop mechanisms to detect and handle conflicting or contradictory relationships within the knowledge graph.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create ConflictDetector class to identify potentially contradictory relationships
2. Implement conflict detection algorithms (direct contradictions, logical inconsistencies)
3. Develop conflict resolution strategies (confidence-based, recency-based, query GPT-4o)
4. Add user feedback integration for manual conflict resolution
5. Implement conflict logging and reporting
6. Create visualization helpers for conflict understanding

Testing approach:
- Test with deliberately contradictory statement sets
- Validate detection of various conflict types
- Verify resolution strategies produce consistent graphs
- Measure detection accuracy against manually labeled conflicts

## 5. Create Graph Persistence and Integrity Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Implement persistence layer for the knowledge graph and tools to validate and maintain graph integrity.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design database schema for graph storage (nodes, edges, metadata)
2. Implement GraphRepository class for CRUD operations
3. Create efficient serialization/deserialization for graph import/export
4. Develop integrity validation tools (orphaned nodes, invalid edges, cycles)
5. Implement automated integrity checks and repair functions
6. Add versioning and change tracking for graph evolution

Testing approach:
- Test persistence with save/load cycles and data integrity checks
- Verify handling of large graphs with performance testing
- Test integrity validation with deliberately corrupted graphs
- Validate versioning with simulated graph evolution scenarios
