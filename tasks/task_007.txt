# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Knowledge State Analysis Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an algorithm that analyzes the current knowledge state to identify gaps, exploration opportunities, and potential areas for further investigation based on user goals.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a data structure to represent the knowledge state, including explored topics, confidence levels, and relationships between knowledge entities.
2. Implement functions to identify knowledge gaps by comparing current knowledge against desired knowledge coverage.
3. Create methods to detect promising exploration paths based on existing knowledge connections.
4. Develop scoring mechanisms to evaluate potential exploration directions based on relevance to user goals.
5. Build visualization tools to represent the knowledge state for debugging and monitoring.

Testing approach:
- Create test cases with sample knowledge states and verify gap identification.
- Validate that the algorithm correctly identifies high-value exploration opportunities.
- Benchmark performance with large knowledge states to ensure scalability.

## 2. Develop GPT-4o Prompt Engineering for Task Formulation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Engineer prompts for GPT-4o that generate specific, actionable exploration tasks based on the knowledge state analysis, ensuring tasks are well-defined with clear objectives.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design base prompt templates that instruct GPT-4o to generate exploration tasks with specific formats (reasoning, actions, focus keywords).
2. Implement dynamic prompt construction that incorporates knowledge state analysis outputs from subtask 1.
3. Create validation mechanisms to ensure generated tasks meet quality criteria (specificity, actionability, relevance).
4. Build prompt refinement functions that can iteratively improve prompts based on task quality feedback.
5. Implement caching and optimization to reduce API costs when generating similar tasks.

Testing approach:
- Evaluate task quality metrics (specificity, relevance, actionability) across different knowledge domains.
- Compare tasks generated with different prompt variations to identify optimal approaches.
- Test with edge cases (very sparse or very dense knowledge states) to ensure robust task generation.

## 3. Build Task Prioritization and Dependency Tracking System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create a system that prioritizes generated tasks and tracks dependencies between them to optimize the exploration path and task execution sequence.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a priority scoring algorithm that considers factors like knowledge gap size, relevance to user goals, and exploration potential.
2. Implement dependency detection between tasks based on knowledge prerequisites and logical sequencing.
3. Create a task graph data structure to represent relationships between tasks.
4. Develop algorithms for optimal task sequencing that respects dependencies while maximizing exploration efficiency.
5. Build interfaces for manual adjustment of priorities and dependencies when needed.

Testing approach:
- Create test task sets with known optimal orderings and verify the system produces expected sequences.
- Test with cyclical dependencies to ensure the system detects and resolves them appropriately.
- Benchmark performance with large task sets to ensure scalability.
- Validate that high-priority tasks addressing critical knowledge gaps are correctly identified.

## 4. Implement Task Effectiveness Feedback Loop [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Develop a feedback system that evaluates the effectiveness of completed tasks and adjusts the task generation strategy based on outcomes to improve future task quality.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design metrics to evaluate task effectiveness (knowledge gained, goal progress, exploration efficiency).
2. Implement data collection mechanisms to capture task outcomes and knowledge state changes after task completion.
3. Create analysis functions to correlate task characteristics with effectiveness metrics.
4. Develop strategy adjustment algorithms that modify task generation parameters based on historical effectiveness data.
5. Build a visualization dashboard for monitoring task effectiveness trends over time.

Testing approach:
- Simulate task execution sequences and verify the feedback system correctly identifies effective vs. ineffective tasks.
- Test the adaptation mechanism with deliberately poor initial strategies to confirm improvement over time.
- Validate that strategy adjustments result in measurable improvements in task quality metrics.
- Ensure the system is robust to outliers and noise in effectiveness measurements.
