# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Cross-Scale and Multi-Label Validation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a validation system that ensures consistency and correctness across multiple biological scales and overlapping labels in the categorization system.
# Details:
This task involves creating a comprehensive validation framework that checks the logical consistency of multi-label assignments and cross-scale relationships in our hierarchical model. Key implementation components include:

1. Cross-scale consistency validators: Implement rules that ensure statements categorized at different biological scales maintain logical consistency (e.g., a molecular process should align with related cellular functions).

2. Multi-label validation logic: Create algorithms to verify that when multiple labels are assigned to a statement, they are logically compatible and don't contain contradictory classifications.

3. Confidence scoring: Implement a system that calculates confidence scores for categorizations based on potential conflicts or ambiguities in multi-label scenarios.

4. Error detection and reporting: Develop comprehensive error and warning messages that precisely identify the nature of validation failures, including specific rule violations and suggested corrections.

5. Edge case handling: Address special cases where apparent contradictions might actually be valid scientific concepts that span multiple scales or categories.

The system should integrate with the existing multi-scale hierarchical model developed in Task 3, accessing the categorization data structure directly rather than creating duplicate logic.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the technical implementation and biological validity of the validation system:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test each validation rule independently with known valid and invalid examples
   - Verify error messages are clear and actionable
   - Test edge cases where validation rules might conflict

2. Integration tests:
   - Process a diverse corpus of pre-categorized statements with known cross-scale relationships
   - Verify that valid multi-label assignments pass validation
   - Confirm that intentionally contradictory labels trigger appropriate warnings

3. Biological validation:
   - Create a test suite of biologically complex examples that span multiple scales
   - Include examples of emergent properties where lower-scale processes create higher-scale effects
   - Have domain experts review a sample of validation results for biological accuracy

4. Performance testing:
   - Measure validation speed on large datasets
   - Ensure memory usage remains reasonable with complex hierarchical relationships

5. Regression testing:
   - Create a benchmark dataset of edge cases to ensure future changes don't break validation logic
