# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Architecture and Environment
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish the foundational architecture for Scientific Voyager, including module structure, API definitions, and development environment setup.
# Details:
Create a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns: data ingestion, processing, storage, and presentation layers. Set up development environment with Python 3.10+, configure OpenAI API integration for GPT-4o, establish project repository with proper documentation structure. Define interfaces between components to ensure scalability. Create configuration management for different deployment environments.

# Test Strategy:
Verify environment setup with automated checks. Test API connectivity to OpenAI. Create integration tests to validate module communication paths. Document architecture with diagrams and validate with stakeholders.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Core Module Structure and Package Organization [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement the foundational module structure with clear separation of concerns, including data ingestion, processing, storage, and presentation layers.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create project root directory with descriptive name
2. Establish main package structure with modules for:
   - data_ingestion: for retrieving data from external sources
   - data_processing: for transforming and analyzing data
   - storage: for data persistence and retrieval
   - presentation: for rendering outputs to users
   - core: for shared utilities and common functionality
3. Create __init__.py files for proper Python package structure
4. Implement basic module-level docstrings explaining each component's purpose
5. Define clear import patterns between modules to maintain separation of concerns
6. Create README.md with module structure documentation

Testing approach:
- Verify package imports work correctly
- Ensure basic directory structure matches design specifications
- Review documentation for clarity and completeness

## 2. Define API Interfaces and Component Contracts [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Design and document the interfaces between system components, ensuring clear contracts between modules for maintainability and scalability.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. For each module defined in subtask 1, create interface definitions:
   - Define abstract base classes for key components using Python's ABC module
   - Document input/output contracts for each public method
   - Specify error handling and exception patterns
2. Create interface for OpenAI API integration:
   - Define wrapper classes for GPT-4o interactions
   - Establish retry and error handling patterns
   - Document rate limiting and token management approaches
3. Design data transfer objects (DTOs) for communication between layers
4. Document all interfaces in Markdown within an 'interfaces/' directory
5. Create sequence diagrams showing component interactions

Testing approach:
- Create stub implementations to verify interface contracts
- Review interface definitions with team members
- Ensure all public methods have clear documentation

## 3. Set Up Development Environment and Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Configure the development environment with all necessary tools, libraries, and dependencies for consistent development across the team.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create requirements.txt and/or pyproject.toml with core dependencies:
   - Python 3.10+ as minimum version
   - OpenAI Python client library
   - Testing frameworks (pytest)
   - Code quality tools (black, isort, flake8, mypy)
   - Any other required libraries
2. Set up virtual environment management:
   - Create scripts for venv creation
   - Document activation process
3. Configure development tools:
   - Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality
   - Configure editor settings (.editorconfig)
   - Set up linting configuration files
4. Create Makefile or equivalent with common commands
5. Document environment setup process in CONTRIBUTING.md

Testing approach:
- Create fresh environment and verify setup process works
- Run automated tests to ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Verify code quality tools work as expected

## 4. Establish Repository Structure and Documentation Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.3
### Description: Set up the Git repository with proper structure, documentation templates, and contribution guidelines to facilitate collaborative development.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Initialize Git repository with appropriate .gitignore file
2. Create documentation structure:
   - README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and usage examples
   - CONTRIBUTING.md with development workflow and guidelines
   - docs/ directory with detailed technical documentation
   - API documentation templates using a tool like Sphinx
3. Set up issue and PR templates in .github/ directory
4. Create LICENSE file with appropriate license
5. Establish branch protection rules and code review guidelines
6. Configure CI/CD pipeline skeleton (GitHub Actions or equivalent)
7. Document Git workflow (branching strategy, commit message format)

Testing approach:
- Review documentation for completeness and clarity
- Test documentation build process if using tools like Sphinx
- Verify CI/CD pipeline configuration with test commits

## 5. Implement Configuration Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Create a flexible configuration management system that supports different deployment environments (development, testing, production) with appropriate security measures.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design configuration structure:
   - Create config/ directory for configuration files
   - Implement hierarchical configuration with environment-specific overrides
   - Separate sensitive from non-sensitive configuration
2. Implement configuration loading mechanism:
   - Support for environment variables
   - Support for .env files (using python-dotenv or similar)
   - Support for YAML/JSON configuration files
3. Create secure storage for API keys and sensitive data:
   - Implement template for .env.example with placeholder values
   - Document secure handling of API keys
   - Add OpenAI API key configuration
4. Create configuration validation logic:
   - Implement schema validation for configuration
   - Add startup checks for required configuration
5. Document configuration system in docs/configuration.md

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for configuration loading and validation
- Test with different environment configurations
- Verify sensitive data handling practices
- Ensure proper error messages for missing/invalid configuration
