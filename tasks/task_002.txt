# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Scientific Literature Extraction Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the component responsible for extracting scientific literature from sources like PubMed and processing abstracts for further analysis.
# Details:
Create adapters for different data sources (starting with PubMed API). Implement abstract extraction, cleaning, and normalization. Build a queue system for processing large volumes of papers. Develop a caching mechanism to avoid redundant API calls. Ensure proper error handling and retry logic for network failures. Add logging for extraction processes. Create configuration for controlling batch sizes and rate limiting.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with mock responses for API calls. Integration tests with small sample datasets. Measure extraction accuracy using known papers. Test error handling with simulated network failures. Validate output format consistency.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement PubMed API Adapter [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an adapter for the PubMed API to fetch scientific literature data
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a PubMedAdapter class that handles API authentication and requests
2. Implement methods for searching articles by keywords, date ranges, and other relevant parameters
3. Add functionality to fetch full article metadata including authors, journal, publication date, DOI
4. Implement rate limiting according to PubMed API guidelines
5. Create a standard response format that normalizes the PubMed data structure
6. Add comprehensive logging for API interactions
7. Write unit tests using mock responses to verify adapter functionality
8. Create configuration for API endpoints, authentication, and request parameters

Testing approach:
- Unit test the adapter with mock API responses
- Integration test with the actual PubMed API using a small set of test queries
- Verify proper handling of various response types and edge cases

## 2. Build Abstract Extraction and Normalization Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop a pipeline for extracting, cleaning, and normalizing scientific abstracts from the retrieved literature
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create an AbstractProcessor class that accepts data from the PubMed adapter
2. Implement text extraction logic to isolate abstract content from full article metadata
3. Develop cleaning functions to handle common issues in scientific text (special characters, formatting)
4. Build normalization processes including:
   - Text standardization (lowercase, whitespace normalization)
   - Scientific terminology standardization
   - Acronym detection and expansion
5. Implement entity recognition for key scientific elements (methods, results, conclusions)
6. Create a standardized output format for processed abstracts
7. Add configurable processing options (level of cleaning, normalization steps to apply)

Testing approach:
- Unit test each processing function with various abstract samples
- Create a test suite with diverse scientific abstracts to verify robustness
- Validate that the pipeline preserves scientific meaning while standardizing format

## 3. Develop Queue System for Batch Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Implement a queue system to manage processing of large volumes of scientific papers
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design a queue data structure to store pending extraction and processing tasks
2. Implement a worker system that processes queue items asynchronously
3. Create batch processing functionality with configurable batch sizes
4. Add prioritization logic for different types of literature requests
5. Implement monitoring and reporting of queue status and processing metrics
6. Build pause/resume capabilities for controlling processing flow
7. Add distributed processing support for handling very large volumes
8. Implement queue persistence to handle service restarts

Testing approach:
- Test queue operations with varying load conditions
- Verify batch processing with different batch sizes
- Stress test with large volumes of papers
- Test recovery scenarios after simulated failures

## 4. Implement Caching and Error Handling Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Create caching system to avoid redundant API calls and implement robust error handling with retry logic
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design a caching system for API responses using a key-value store
2. Implement cache invalidation policies based on time and content changes
3. Create a comprehensive error handling framework that categorizes different failure types:
   - Network failures
   - API rate limiting/throttling
   - Data format issues
   - Processing errors
4. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
5. Develop fallback mechanisms for critical failures
6. Create detailed error logging and alerting for persistent issues
7. Add configuration options for cache TTL, retry attempts, and backoff parameters
8. Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures

Testing approach:
- Test cache hit/miss scenarios and verify cache effectiveness
- Simulate various error conditions to verify proper handling
- Measure performance improvements from caching
- Verify retry logic works correctly under different failure scenarios
