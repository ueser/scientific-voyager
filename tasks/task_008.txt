# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Search and Retrieval System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive search and retrieval system for indexed statements, insights, and relationships.
# Details:
Implement keyword-based search across all indexed content. Build concept-based retrieval using semantic similarity. Create faceted search with filters for biological levels, statement types, etc. Implement relevance ranking algorithms. Develop query expansion for improved recall. Build search result visualization with relationship highlighting. Create API endpoints for programmatic search access. Implement search history and saved searches functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark search performance with large datasets. Test precision and recall with known query sets. Validate relevance ranking against human judgments. Test complex boolean queries. Measure search latency under load. Verify faceted filtering accuracy.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Keyword and Concept-Based Search Core [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the foundational search functionality supporting both keyword-based and semantic concept-based search across all indexed content
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a search service class that will handle different search types
2. Implement keyword-based search using inverted indices for exact and partial matching
3. Integrate vector embeddings for concept-based semantic similarity search
4. Build a unified search interface that combines results from both approaches
5. Implement basic result scoring based on term frequency and semantic relevance
6. Create unit tests for both search types with various query patterns
7. Benchmark search performance with different index sizes

Testing approach:
- Unit test each search method independently with known test data
- Test edge cases like empty queries, special characters, and very large result sets
- Validate semantic search returns conceptually related items even without exact keyword matches

## 2. Build Faceted Search and Filtering System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive filtering system that allows users to narrow search results by various dimensions including biological levels, statement types, and other metadata
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Define the schema for facet types (biological levels, statement types, etc.)
2. Extend the search service to support filter application
3. Implement filter combinators (AND, OR logic between filters)
4. Create dynamic facet generation based on result sets
5. Develop facet count calculation to show available filter options
6. Optimize filter application to maintain search performance
7. Build UI components for displaying and selecting facets

Testing approach:
- Test filter application with various combinations of facets
- Verify facet counts accurately reflect available options
- Test performance with large result sets and multiple filters
- Ensure filters properly narrow results without excluding valid matches

## 3. Develop Relevance Ranking and Query Expansion Algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Implement advanced algorithms for ranking search results by relevance and expanding queries to improve recall
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a modular scoring system that considers multiple relevance factors
2. Implement TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) based ranking
3. Add recency and popularity signals to the ranking algorithm
4. Create a query expansion module using synonyms and related terms
5. Implement context-aware expansion based on biological domain knowledge
6. Develop a feedback mechanism to improve rankings based on user interactions
7. Build visualization components to highlight relationships between search results

Testing approach:
- Compare ranking results against expert-curated expected outcomes
- Measure recall improvement with query expansion
- A/B test different ranking algorithms with sample user queries
- Validate that relationship highlighting correctly identifies connections

## 4. Create Search API and History Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Develop API endpoints for programmatic search access and implement functionality for tracking search history and saving searches
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design RESTful API endpoints for all search capabilities
2. Implement API authentication and rate limiting
3. Create comprehensive API documentation with examples
4. Develop a search history tracking system tied to user accounts
5. Build functionality to save searches with custom names
6. Implement export options for search results (JSON, CSV)
7. Create admin analytics dashboard for monitoring popular searches
8. Add notification system for saved searches with new matching results

Testing approach:
- Test API endpoints with various query parameters
- Verify history tracking correctly stores search metadata
- Test saved searches with both existing and new user accounts
- Validate that search history properly handles pagination and filtering
- Perform load testing on API endpoints to ensure scalability
