# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Multi-scale Hierarchical Model and Categorization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the system to categorize extracted statements into biological scales (genetic, molecular, cellular, systems, organism) and statement types.
# Details:
Implement prompt engineering for GPT-4o to categorize statements by biological level. Create classification logic for statement types (causal, descriptive, intervention, definitional). Develop a validation layer to ensure classification quality. Build a feedback mechanism to improve categorization accuracy over time. Create a taxonomy manager to maintain classification hierarchies. Implement confidence scoring for categorizations.

# Test Strategy:
Test with gold-standard pre-categorized statements. Create confusion matrix to measure classification accuracy. Implement human-in-the-loop validation for a sample of categorizations. Benchmark performance against baseline heuristics. Test edge cases of ambiguous statements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Prompt Engineering for Biological Scale Classification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop effective prompts for GPT-4o to accurately categorize biological statements into genetic, molecular, cellular, systems, and organism scales.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Research and compile examples of statements at each biological scale for training data
2. Design initial prompt templates with clear instructions and examples for scale classification
3. Implement a prompt engineering module that formats statements for classification
4. Create a testing harness to evaluate prompt effectiveness with sample statements
5. Iterate on prompt design based on classification accuracy
6. Document prompt patterns that yield the highest accuracy

Testing approach:
- Use a curated set of pre-classified statements to measure classification accuracy
- Implement confusion matrix analysis to identify which scales are frequently misclassified
- Perform A/B testing of different prompt variations to determine optimal approach

## 2. Develop Statement Type Classification System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a system to classify statements into types: causal, descriptive, intervention, and definitional categories.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Define clear criteria and characteristics for each statement type
2. Develop classification logic using NLP techniques and pattern recognition
3. Implement a classification module that processes statements and returns their type
4. Build type-specific prompt enhancements that leverage the biological scale classification
5. Create a unified API that returns both scale and type classifications
6. Implement error handling for ambiguous statements

Testing approach:
- Create a test suite with examples of each statement type
- Measure precision and recall for each statement type classification
- Test edge cases where statements might belong to multiple types
- Validate that the system works correctly when integrated with the scale classification

## 3. Build Validation and Quality Assurance Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Develop a validation system to ensure classification quality and accuracy for both biological scales and statement types.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design validation rules and constraints for each classification category
2. Implement consistency checks to flag potentially incorrect classifications
3. Create a validation pipeline that processes classification results
4. Develop a scoring system to quantify classification quality
5. Build a reporting module to highlight problematic classifications
6. Implement an override mechanism for manual correction of misclassifications

Testing approach:
- Test with deliberately misclassified statements to ensure detection
- Validate that the system correctly identifies edge cases and ambiguities
- Measure the validation system's ability to improve overall classification accuracy
- Test integration with both scale and type classification systems

## 4. Implement Feedback Mechanism for Classification Improvement [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Create a system to collect, process, and incorporate feedback to continuously improve categorization accuracy over time.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a feedback collection interface for both automated and human feedback
2. Implement a feedback database to store correction data and improvement suggestions
3. Create an analysis module to identify patterns in classification errors
4. Develop a prompt refinement system that automatically adjusts prompts based on feedback
5. Build a retraining pipeline for periodic model updates
6. Implement metrics to track improvement over time

Testing approach:
- Simulate feedback scenarios to test the system's ability to incorporate corrections
- Measure classification improvement rates after feedback integration
- Test the feedback loop with actual users to validate usability
- Verify that the system properly prioritizes and applies the most impactful feedback

## 5. Develop Confidence Scoring and Taxonomy Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Implement confidence scoring for categorizations and build a taxonomy manager to maintain and update classification hierarchies.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a confidence scoring algorithm based on model outputs and validation results
2. Implement the confidence scoring module for both scale and type classifications
3. Create a taxonomy data structure to represent classification hierarchies
4. Build a taxonomy manager interface for viewing and editing taxonomies
5. Implement versioning for taxonomies to track changes over time
6. Develop integration between confidence scores and the feedback mechanism

Testing approach:
- Validate that confidence scores correlate with actual classification accuracy
- Test taxonomy updates to ensure they propagate correctly through the system
- Verify that low-confidence classifications are properly flagged for review
- Test the system's ability to maintain taxonomy integrity during updates
