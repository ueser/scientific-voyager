# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Statement Storage and Indexing System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the data storage infrastructure for extracted and categorized statements with proper indexing and UID assignment.
# Details:
Implement local storage for prototype phase. Design database schema for Neo4j implementation. Create UID generation system ensuring uniqueness and traceability. Build indexing mechanism for biomedical terms and concepts. Implement versioning for statements that may be updated. Develop data access layer with abstraction to switch between storage backends. Create migration tools for transitioning from local to database storage.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark read/write performance. Test concurrent access patterns. Verify data integrity after CRUD operations. Test UID uniqueness under load. Validate indexing effectiveness with search performance tests. Verify successful data migration between storage systems.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Local Storage System for Statements [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a file-based storage system for extracted biomedical statements that will serve during the prototype phase
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Define a statement data model with fields for content, metadata, source, timestamp, and version information
2. Create a directory structure for organizing statement files (e.g., by category, date, or source)
3. Implement functions to serialize/deserialize statements to/from JSON files
4. Add CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for statement management
5. Implement basic search functionality based on file metadata
6. Add error handling and data validation
7. Implement simple backup mechanism

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for CRUD operations
- Test with sample statements of varying complexity
- Verify data integrity after read/write operations
- Performance testing with larger datasets to identify bottlenecks

## 2. Design and Implement UID Generation and Indexing System [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a system for generating unique identifiers for statements and build an indexing mechanism for biomedical terms and concepts
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design UID schema that ensures uniqueness and traceability (consider using UUIDs with additional metadata encoded)
2. Implement UID generator function with collision detection
3. Create an index structure for biomedical terms/concepts extraction
4. Build term extraction logic to identify key biomedical concepts from statements
5. Implement forward and inverted indices for efficient lookup
6. Create functions to update indices when statements are added/modified/deleted
7. Implement versioning system for statements that may be updated

Testing approach:
- Verify UID uniqueness with large batches of generated IDs
- Test indexing with sample biomedical text containing known terms
- Benchmark index lookup performance
- Test versioning system with statement updates

## 3. Design and Implement Neo4j Database Schema [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Create a graph database schema in Neo4j for storing biomedical statements and their relationships
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design Neo4j nodes and relationships schema for biomedical statements
2. Define properties for statement nodes (using UID system from subtask 2)
3. Create relationship types for different statement associations
4. Implement Cypher queries for basic CRUD operations
5. Set up indices in Neo4j for optimized query performance
6. Implement constraint validations for data integrity
7. Create database initialization and setup scripts

Testing approach:
- Verify schema with test data insertion and retrieval
- Test complex relationship queries
- Benchmark performance with larger datasets
- Validate constraints and data integrity rules
- Test recovery from failure scenarios

## 4. Develop Data Access Layer with Storage Backend Abstraction [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Create an abstraction layer that allows seamless switching between storage backends and implement migration tools
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Define abstract interfaces for storage operations (independent of backend)
2. Implement concrete adapter classes for both local storage and Neo4j backends
3. Create a factory pattern for instantiating the appropriate storage backend
4. Build configuration system to control backend selection
5. Implement migration tools to transfer data between storage backends
6. Add data validation during migration to ensure integrity
7. Create logging and monitoring for storage operations
8. Implement graceful fallback mechanisms in case of backend failures

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for each adapter implementation
- Integration tests verifying seamless backend switching
- Test migration tools with various dataset sizes
- Verify data consistency before and after migration
- Performance comparison between different backends
- Test error handling and recovery scenarios
